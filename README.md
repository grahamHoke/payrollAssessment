# Payroll Code Assessment

This program reads a CSV file containing data on employees and hours worked and outputs the following reports:

- the sum of total wage payments for all employees
- a list of departments sorted by total department wage payments, most to least 
- a list of employees, sorted alphabetically, with each employees weekly base wage payment

*Things to add:*

- Handle duplicate employee names
- input validation, e.g. better number parsing, triming, long strings, weekly hours outside 0-168 range
- exception handling could be more specific
- Use constants and enums for hourly rates
- Beautify output.
